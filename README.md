# Downloading the Web App
To download the Web App, there are different methods based on different browsers or devices.

If you are using Firefox, Brave, or Chrome on a Windows computer there will be a small (+) sign on the right hand side of the URL bar when you are on the home page. By clicking on this you will be given an option to download the Web App to your desktop, or cancel. The symbol will not be available if the app has already been been downloaded. Uninstall the app to regain the ability to download it. e.g.:

![](readme/ff.png?raw=true "Brave Browser plus")

![](readme/pc.png?raw=true "Brave Browser dialogue")

If you're using an Android device, an "Add to home screen" dialog box will pop up on the home page and you can choose to download it or cancel.

If you're using an iOS device (Safari Browser), press the share button at the top of the browser bar, then click on add to home screen.
